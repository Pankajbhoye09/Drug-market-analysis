The provided Python code analyzes sales data for three pharmaceutical products: Imperialumab, Uclumab, and Kingsumab, with the aim to understand market trends and performance.


The Jupyter notebook script provided is designed for analyzing sales data related to a pharmaceutical product called "Imperialumab." The script begins by importing essential Python libraries: `pandas` for data manipulation, `numpy` for numerical operations, and `matplotlib` for data visualization. The main focus is on evaluating the market performance of Imperialumab, along with two other products, Uclumab and Kingsumab, over time.

Data is loaded from an Excel file containing sales figures, and the total market value is calculated by summing up the sales of the three products. The cumulative sales data is then displayed and plotted for visual analysis. This approach helps in identifying trends, comparing market shares, and understanding the overall market conditions affecting Imperialumab's performance.

The notebook also includes markdown cells outlining key business questions, specifically regarding the market conditions driving Imperialumabâ€™s performance and potential strategic actions to improve its market position. This structure allows for a comprehensive analysis, guiding stakeholders in making informed decisions. The use of data support through visualizations and cumulative data ensures a clear understanding of the sales dynamics over the specified period.
